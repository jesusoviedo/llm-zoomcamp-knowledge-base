       "'Based on the context provided, the highly rated movies that are based in or originate from Eastern countries are:\\n\\n### 1. Apocalypse Now\\n- **Synopsis**: In Vietnam in 1970, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) takes a perilous and increasingly hallucinatory journey upriver to find and terminate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a once-promising officer who has reportedly gone completely mad. In the company of a Navy patrol boat filled with street-smart kids, a surfing-obsessed Air Cavalry officer (Robert Duvall), and a crazed freelance photographer (Dennis Hopper), Willard travels further and further into the heart of darkness.\\n- **Critic score**: 98\\n- **People score**: 94.0\\n- **Consensus**: Francis Ford Coppola\\'s haunting, hallucinatory Vietnam War epic is cinema at its most audacious and visionary.\\n\\n### 2. A Fistful of Dollars\\n- **Synopsis**: The Man With No Name (Clint Eastwood) enters the Mexican village of San Miguel in the midst of a power struggle among the three Rojo brothers (Antonio Prieto, Benny Reeves, Sieghardt Rupp) and sheriff John Baxter (Wolfgang Lukschy). When a regiment of Mexican soldiers bearing gold intended to pay for new weapons is waylaid by the Rojo brothers, the stranger inserts himself into the middle of the long-simmering battle, selling false information to both sides for his own benefit.\\n- **Critic score**: 98\\n- **People score**: 91.0\\n- **Consensus**: With Akira Kurosawa\\'s Yojimbo as his template, Sergio Leone\\'s A Fistful of Dollars helped define a new era for the Western and usher in its most iconic star, Clint Eastwood.\\n\\n### Summary of the Consensus\\nBoth films, \"Apocalypse Now\" and \"A Fistful of Dollars,\" showcase a high level of cinematic artistry and storytelling that capture the essence of the tumultuous settings they depict. \"Apocalypse Now\" is lauded for its visionary portrayal of the Vietnam War and the psychological journey of its protagonist, while \"A Fistful of Dollars\" is recognized for its influential role in redefining the Western genre, drawing inspiration from Eastern cinema.'"
